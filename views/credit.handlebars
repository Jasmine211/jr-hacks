<h1>Building Your Credit!</h1>
<div class="infoBody">
<h2>Creating Credit</h2>
<p>In order to build credit, it is important to know what credit actually is.
  Credit is the ability to borrow money with the intent to repay the amount
  later. A very important aspect of credit in this day and age is a Credit
  Score. A Credit Score is a way for companies or institutions to measure
  someone’s creditworthiness, which is how likely they are to repay the debt
  based on previous credit chances. A credit score ranges from 300 to 850, where
  the higher the credit score, the higher your creditworthiness is.
</p>
<p>Building credit is important because the sooner one starts, the better the
  chances of getting a higher credit score. For young adults, it is particularly
  important to build credit because when they grow older, they have more chances
  to show their creditworthiness when trying to take out loans for a car or take
  out a mortgage.</p>
<p>The best way to build credit is to first, start your credit journey. This
  means taking out loans, credit cards, and many more. A very important thing to
  note is to be mindful when starting your credit journey. It is important to
  feel and be ready when opening credit cards and taking out loans. Doing these
  actions takes a lot of responsibility and discipline in order to build credit
  successfully.
</p>
<p>The types of things that one can do to start their credit journey is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Getting a credit card (Preferably a secured one)</li>
  <li>Taking out a loan
    <ul><li>School</li><li>Personal</li><li>Loan</li></ul></li>
  <li>Becoming an authorized user on someone else’s credit card (A person with
    good credit)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When building credit, there are many factors that are taken into account when
  establishing your credit score. These include:</p>
<h3>Payment History (35%)</h3>
<p>That refers to the payments that you have made toward your debt. This
  category is mostly affected when you make a payment late, which brings your
  credit down and accounts for 35% of your whole credit score, so it is
  extremely important to pay your loan payments by the due date, if you can, in
  full. On the other hand, if you successfully make payments by their due dates
  and are consistent, then your credit goes up.</p>
<h3>Total Balances Owed (30%)</h3>
<p>The total balances are all the amounts that are owed from all types of debt
  you took out combined. So, when you have available credit, the lower the
  outstanding balance, the higher your credit score. A good rule of thumb is to
  always try to use less than 30% of your available credit. So if your available
  credit is $10,000, then you should try to aim to use about max $3,000.</p>
<h3>Length of Credit History (15%)</h3>

<p>The length of your credit history also impacts your credit score. In this
  case, the longer that you have had credit available to you, the higher your
  credit score will be. A good thing to note here is that if, for example, you
  have had a credit line for five years and you close it, your credit history
  will shorten, which in turn will lower your credit score.
</p>
<h3>Amount of Credit Checks (10%)</h3>
<p>
  First of all, a credit check refers to an impact on your credit report Hard
  inquiries affect your credit score negatively and can Soft inquiries occur
  when your credit score is checked while conducting a background check. In
  comparison to hard inquiries, for the most part sot inquiries do not affect
  your credit score
</p>

<h3>
  Types of Credit You Use (10%)
</h3>
<p>There are three types of credits: installment, revolving, and open credit.
  Installment credit (student loans, mortgages, auto loans,...) refers to
  borrowing a lump of money and paying it back in a fixed payment plan.
  Revolving credit (personal line of credit, business line of credit, credit
  cards,...) refers to borrowing money up to a predetermined limit, making
  monthly payments to pay it back, and borrowing money again as needed. An open
  credit refers to borrowing from a predetermined limit and paying it back in
  full each month. Having a mix of different types of credit is helpful in
  increasing your credit score and demonstrates that you can handle having
  different types of debts.
